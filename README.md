## Projects
<p> Project 1: Modeling Changes in Student Balances</p>
<p> Overview: <p>In this project, I analyzed the dynamics of lesson purchases and completions within an educational platform over a year. The goal was to identify trends, seasonal impacts, and potential areas for improving student engagement and lesson completion rates.<p>
<ol>
  <li>Task</li> Calculate the total number of lessons in the balance of all students for each calendar day.
  <li>Task</li> Analyze how this number changed due to transactions (payments, accruals, corrective debits) and lessons (debits from the balance as lessons were taken).
  <li>Task</li> Develop a table that shows the balance of each student for every day.
</ol>

<p>Approach:<p>
<p>To tackle these challenges, the following steps were taken:<p>
<li>Data Collection: Gathered detailed transaction and lesson completion data for each student over a specified period.
<li>Data Processing: Developed scripts to aggregate daily balances across all students and track daily changes influenced by various transactions.
<li>Data Analysis: Employed statistical tools to analyze trends and patterns in the data, ensuring all calculations were accurate and reflective of real-world behaviors.
<li>Visualization: Created visual representations of data trends to better understand the dynamics of student balances and to facilitate easier reporting and decision-making.<p>

<p>Conclusions:<p>
<ol>
  <p>This project offered crucial insights into student behavior and their engagement with lessons on the educational platform. By identifying the specific times when students are most likely to purchase and complete lessons, along with pinpointing potential engagement issues with the content, we can refine our strategies to improve the overall learning experience. Looking ahead, we could consider revising course materials in response to student feedback, optimizing content delivery to align with different seasonal patterns, and capitalizing on promotional periods to increase lesson completion rates.</li>

<p> Project 2: Optimizing Retail Performance: Multi-City A/B Testing at SkyLenta</p>
<p> Overview: <p>As a data analyst in the Product Analytics Department at SkyLenta, my project focused on analyzing an A/B test conducted across various locations to optimize marketing strategies by evaluating transactional data at different retail points.<p>
<ol>
  <li>Task</li> Import and thoroughly analyze data tables to verify the integrity and usability of the data involved in the A/B test.
  <li>Task</li> Clean the data by removing entries from retail points with zero payments or zero customers in either the control or test group.
  <li>Task</li> Create a detailed table that effectively stores and displays the A/B test results for each retail point, making the data easily accessible and interpretable.
  <li>Task</li> Automate the computation of statistical analyses to streamline the evaluation process of the A/B test results.
  <li>Task</li> Segment the A/B test outcomes into positive, negative, and neutral results based on their impact and significance to further refine marketing strategies.
</ol>

<p>Approach:<p>
The project was approached by initially gathering and cleaning the necessary data to ensure a reliable basis for the A/B test analysis. A comprehensive table was then constructed to visualize the outcomes effectively. Statistical tests, including the t-test and Mann-Whitney U test, were automated to assess the differences between control and test groups systematically. This automation helped in quickly identifying significant changes without manual recalculations. Additionally, for retail points with insufficient data, a calculation model was developed to estimate the number of observations needed to detect significant differences in future tests.

<p>Conclusions:<p>
<ol>
  <p>Conclusion 1: The project successfully provided a clear and structured analysis of the A/B test, revealing how different promotional strategies performed across various retail locations.<p>
<p>Conclusion 2: The automated tools developed for statistical analysis significantly enhanced efficiency, allowing for quick adjustments and informed decision-making.<p>
<p>Conclusion 3: The segmentation of test results facilitated a deeper understanding of each retail point's performance, which is crucial for tailoring specific marketing strategies to maximize customer engagement and profitability.<p>
<p>Conclusion 4: The estimation model for required observations proved essential for planning future A/B tests, ensuring that each test is backed by sufficient data to yield statistically reliable results.<p>

<p> Project 3: User Retention Analysis Across Marketing Channels in Power BI</p>
<p> Overview: <p>This project involved creating a comprehensive visualization report to analyze user retention metrics across various marketing channels, with a particular focus on Google due to its significant share of our advertising budget. The goal was to assess the quality of traffic each channel generates, particularly looking at retention rates, and to determine if larger channels are diluting the quality of the traffic.<p>
<p>Conclusion:<p>
The visual report successfully highlighted key insights into user behavior and retention across channels. It provided clear evidence on which channels perform best in terms of retaining users and how channel scale impacts user engagement and retention.

<p> Project 4: Client Data Architecture for Optimized Analytics</p>
<p> Overview: <p>In my role, I was tasked with developing a streamlined architecture to optimize the scorecard process, facilitating the collection and prediction of data for data scientists. The central element of this architecture was the Client class, designed to systematically manage and process client data.<p>
<p>Conclusion:<p>
The class includes a constructor to initialize essential client attributes such as first name, last name, year of birth, and gender, along with dictionaries that store information about all of the client's credits. The developed methods of the class allow for the aggregation of data on payments, the total number and volume of credits issued, the percentage of credits paid, as well as the largest credit ever issued and the largest outstanding credit balance. This data structure significantly simplifies the handling of client information and enhances the efficiency of predictive models.

<p> Project 5: Titanic: Machine Learning and Data Visualization</p>
<p> Overview: <p>This project conducts a thorough analysis of the Titanic dataset to unveil key insights into the factors influencing passenger survival. The study integrates advanced data visualization in Power BI and machine learning using Python, focusing on predicting survival outcomes based on various passenger attributes.<p>
<p>Conclusion:<p>
Data Visualization: Leveraged Power BI to create interactive visualizations, showcasing the distribution of passengers by gender, class, and fare, along with their survival rates. This approach provided a clear visual representation of the data, helping to highlight crucial factors that impacted survival chances.
Predictive Modeling: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to predict survival outcomes. The model used passenger data such as ticket class (Pclass), gender (Sex), and fare. It was trained and validated using a split of the dataset to ascertain its predictive accuracy.
