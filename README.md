## Projects
<p> Project 1: Modeling Changes in Student Balances</p>
<p> Overview: <p>In this project, I analyzed the dynamics of lesson purchases and completions within an educational platform over a year. The goal was to identify trends, seasonal impacts, and potential areas for improving student engagement and lesson completion rates.<p>
<ol>
  <li>Task №1</li> Calculate the total number of lessons in the balance of all students for each calendar day.
  <li>Task №2.</li> Analyze how this number changed due to transactions (payments, accruals, corrective debits) and lessons (debits from the balance as lessons were taken).
  <li>Task №3.</li> Develop a table that shows the balance of each student for every day.
</ol>

<p>Approach:<p>
<p>To tackle these challenges, the following steps were taken:<p>
<li>Data Collection: Gathered detailed transaction and lesson completion data for each student over a specified period.
<li>Data Processing: Developed scripts to aggregate daily balances across all students and track daily changes influenced by various transactions.
<li>Data Analysis: Employed statistical tools to analyze trends and patterns in the data, ensuring all calculations were accurate and reflective of real-world behaviors.
<li>Visualization: Created visual representations of data trends to better understand the dynamics of student balances and to facilitate easier reporting and decision-making.<p>
